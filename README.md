#Jekyll-restaurant

Showing how one could use Jekyll as an easy CMS for a restaurant website.

# Deploying

Deploying is done by editing the info in `_config.yml` in your own fork. Don't forget to change the `CNAME`.

# Posting

Posting can be done with the MrHyde app, or the github site. This will only work if the site is on GitHub, so that's preferred.

You can make new blog posts by addig a new file like `2015-09-14-Title.md`, change the menu and other info in `_config.yml`, change colour variables in `_sass/_variables.scss` (don't do this if you don't know what you are doing).

# License

Always ask permission to me ([mail](mailto:hello@haroen me) is fine) before using.
